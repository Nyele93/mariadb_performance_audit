<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size: 13px;">
MariaDB uses the lower of these two variables (tmp and heap) to limit the size of temporary tables in memory. While having this value large can help reduce the number of temporary tables created on disk, it also raises the risk of reaching the server's memory capacity since these are per-client variables.
</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size: 13px;">
Temporary tables are often used for GROUP BY, ORDER BY, DISTINCT, UNION, subqueries, etc. Ideally, MariaDB should create these in memory, with a few on disk as possible. 
</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size: 13px;">
It is important to note that queries not using joins appropriately and creating large temporary tables can be a cause for higher numbers of temporary tables on disk. Another reason is the memory storage engine uses fixed-length columns and assumes a worst-case scenario. If columns are not sized correctly (for example, varchar(255) for a short string), this influences the size of the table in memory and can cause it to go to disk earlier than it should. Also, temporary tables with BLOB and TEXT columns will immediately go to disk as the memory storage engine does not support them.
